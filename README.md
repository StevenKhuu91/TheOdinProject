# TheOdinProject
A repository containing any and all projects and files related to The Odin Project.
This is a representation of my journey in learning Full-Stack Development, and an honest attempt to try harder for the year of 2025.
There's going to be plenty wrong and right with this, but keeping in mind that I need to learn what I can from my successes and failures is the most important thing here, not showing off how "nice" my code is.
